# Advent of code, 2023

Normally I only participate for four days or so, btw.

Setup:

    $ python3 -m venv .
	$ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

Then I have pytest, so I can use the provided test data to validate my
program:

    $ bin/pytest day01

And run the ``__main__`` in script1 or script2 to get the solution:

    $ bin/python day01/script2.py
